Something kick off the front floor/
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something
Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give... me... some... thing... that... is... for... real.
some new

Hate something, somewhere, each day,
Dealing without forgiveness.
Why? this shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give... me... noth... ing... just... feel.
And now this shit will follow.
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
