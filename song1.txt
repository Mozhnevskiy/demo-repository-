Something kick off the front floor/
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something
Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.

Hate, something, somewhere, each day
Feeling ripped off again now
Why? This shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing, just feel
And now this shit will follow
